## What is ConHam?
The ConHam simplex frequency of 146.580 has been in use at DEFCON since at least DC16,
though probably much earlier than that. Standardizing on a single frequency made it much
easier to find other hams in a backchannel way, without depending on sketchy WiFi and
a crazy game of telephone.

## But I thought ham radio was dead?
You thought wrong! There's enough people using RF space at cons like DEFCON that the Ham Radio Village decided to start trying to help coordinate into a central place - jumping from 1 standardized frequency to a whole table, including FM repeaters, digital mode hotspots with repurposed commercial (DMR) and home-grown open source (M17) modes, internet backbones, Meshtastic, cat memes, and other shenanigans.
